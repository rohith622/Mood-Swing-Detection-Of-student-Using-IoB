1. Input Layer

Input Size: 48Ã—48 pixels

Channels: 3 (RGB)

Purpose: Takes in the studentâ€™s facial image for processing.

2. Convolutional Blocks

The CNN uses multiple convolutional blocks to extract features step by step.

ðŸ”¹ Block 1

Conv2D (32 filters) â†’ Detects simple patterns like edges

Batch Normalization â†’ Stabilizes learning

Conv2D (32 filters) â†’ Refines feature extraction

MaxPooling (2Ã—2) â†’ Reduces image size while keeping key info

ðŸ”¹ Block 2

Conv2D (64 filters) â†’ Detects more complex textures

Batch Normalization â†’ Keeps outputs stable

MaxPooling (2Ã—2) â†’ Further shrinks image size

ðŸ”¹ Block 3

Conv2D (128 filters) â†’ Learns shapes & higher-level features

Batch Normalization

MaxPooling (2Ã—2)

ðŸ”¹ Block 4

Conv2D (256 filters) â†’ Extracts fine patterns

Batch Normalization

MaxPooling (2Ã—2)

ðŸ”¹ Block 5

Conv2D (512 filters) â†’ Captures detailed, abstract features

Batch Normalization

3. Fully Connected Layers
ðŸ”¹ Flatten

Converts 3D feature maps into a 1D vector.

ðŸ”¹ Dense (1024 Units)

Learns complex relationships among extracted features.

ðŸ”¹ Dropout

Randomly deactivates some neurons to prevent overfitting.

ðŸ”¹ Output Layer

Dense (7 units, softmax)

Outputs probabilities for 7 emotions:

Surprise

Fear

Sadness

Disgust

Contempt

Happy

Anger
